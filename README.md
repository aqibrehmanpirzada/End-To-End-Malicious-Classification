project_name
==============================

This project focuses on enhancing cybersecurity measures by employing advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to analyze Domain Name System (DNS) traffic. By harnessing the power of these cutting-edge approaches, the system aims to accurately classify and identify malicious domains. Through the intricate analysis of DNS traffic patterns, the model can distinguish between legitimate and potentially harmful domains, providing a robust defense against cyber threats. This innovative approach not only enhances the efficiency of malicious domain detection but also contributes to the continual evolution of cybersecurity frameworks in an increasingly complex digital landscape.
